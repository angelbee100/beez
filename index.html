	<h2> Research of BeeZ</h2>
	<p>Bees make honey to feed their young and so they have something to eat during the winter.
Killer bees have been known to chase people for over a 1/4 mile once they get excited and aggressive.
Certain species of bees die after stinging because their stingers, which are attached to their abdomen, have little barbs or hooks on them. When this type of bee tries to fly away after stinging something, part of the abdomen is ripped away.</p>


	<h2> Bees Biology</h2>
	<p>It has often been said that bees are responsible for one out of every three bites of food we eat. Most crops grown for their fruits (including vegetables such as squash, cucumber, tomato and eggplant), nuts, seeds, fiber (such as cotton), and hay (alfalfa grown to feed livestock), require pollination by insects.</p>
